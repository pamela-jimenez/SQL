#In this SQL code, I'm querying a database called chinook which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT lastname, firstname, customerid, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA'
ORDER BY lastname

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT * FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = 'Brazil'


#3. Find the invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, invoices.InvoiceId, invoices.BillingCountry, invoices.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers
ON invoices.CustomerId = customers.CustomerId 
WHERE invoices.BillingCountry = 'Brazil'

#4. Show the Employees who are sales agents.

SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent'

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM chinook.Invoices

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT employees.LastName, employees.Firstname, invoices.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees
JOIN chinook.customers ON customers.supportRepId = employees.employeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices ON invoices.customerId = customers.customerId

#7. How many invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'

#8. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'

#9. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT tracks.Name, invoice_items.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items
JOIN chinook.Tracks
ON invoice_items.TrackId = tracks.TrackId

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT artists.name as Artist, tracks.Name as Track, invoice_items.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks
ON invoice_items.TrackID=tracks.TrackID
INNER JOIN chinook.albums
ON albums.AlbumID=tracks.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists
ON artists.ArtistID=artists.ArtistID

#11. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name', a.Title AS 'Album Title', m.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.Albums a 
on a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.Media_Types m
on m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.Genres g
on g.GenreId = t.GenreId

#12. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName

#13. Which sales agent made the most money in sales in 2009?

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE "2009%"
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1
